        "In Confessions of a Winning Poker Player, Jack King said, 'few players can recall big pots they've won - strange as it seems - but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy the outstanding tough beats of their career'. Seems true to me, 'cause walkin in here, I can hardly remember how I built my bankroll, but I can't stop thinking about how I lost it." <br>- Mike McDermott, Rounders (1999)
